            <h3>What is a Stock?</h3>
            <p>
                A stock represents a share of ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you're purchasing a small piece of that company, which makes you a shareholder. Companies issue stocks to raise money for various purposes such as expansion, developing new products, or paying off debt.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a shareholder, you generally have the following rights:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vote on major company decisions and board members</li>
                <li>Receive dividends (a portion of company profits) if the company issues them</li>
                <li>Sell your shares to another investor</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-4">How Stock Markets Work</h3>
            <p>
                Stock markets are where buyers and sellers meet to trade shares of publicly listed companies. Today, most trading occurs electronically through exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the NASDAQ.

            <p>
                Stock prices change constantly during trading hours based on supply and demand. Various factors influence stock prices, including:

            <ul>
                <li>Company performance (earnings, revenue growth, profitability)</li>
